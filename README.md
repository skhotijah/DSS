# Decison Support System (DSS)

This Repository contains a simple Decision Support System for selecting a new employee Using Simple Additive Weighting.

The Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method also known as a weighted summation method [1]. The basic concept Simple Additive Weighting method is finding a weighted sum of the performance on each alternative on each attribute. Simple Additive Weighting method suggested completing a settlement in the decision-making system of multi-process. Simple Additive Weighting method is a method that is widely used in making decisions that have a lot of attributes, so that by applying the method of SAW on decision support systems the completion of various decision-making processes can be easily [1], this research testing Simple Additive Weighting method to the case of the easiest to do and with the dynamic criteria that can be applied to different cases quickly.
